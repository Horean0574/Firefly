> 这篇文章亦为新高一开学第一周的~~英语作业~~（老师说周记还配不上作业），要求写一篇英文周记，日后也会成为常规作业，所以每周都要写新的周记。以下为博主所著原版。

It's somewhere familiar to me. The campus didn't vary a lot but my attitude towards school has changed. It's the truth I cannot evit that I must be well prepared to confront the coming life of senior high.

Although the first week has gone and certainly it won't come back, a variety of events happened within this week are still vivid in my mind. Of all those things, I appreciate the maths class of Mr. Zhong most for the reason that he always has lessons in a genuinely fun way, which makes the whole class veiled under a convivial atmosphere. What impressed me most in Mr. Zhong's class were the "triangle into square" event while learning the necessary and sufficient condition. He just wrote a silly statement by mistake!

Some other things that fascinated me are also related to my new teacher, Doris. Leaping to the eyes were five enormous  letters DORIS carved on the screen the moment Doris switches to the next slide of PPT. They separately stand for five different meanings. Those are determination, optimistic, resilience, inspiration and success. It's said additionally that if we perform the first four ones well, we'll easily receive the last one "success"! However, I still have a question about why the last one isn't some of the advanced vocabulary?

These are all the content of my first weekly diary in the brand new semester. Look forward to the better future!

It's a place that feels familiar to me. The campus hasn't changed much, but my attitude towards school has. I cannot deny that I must be well prepared for the challenges of senior high school life.

Although the first week has gone, the variety of events that happened this week are still vivid in my mind, even though it certainly won't come back. Of all of these, I enjoyed Mr Zhong's maths class the most because he always teaches in a genuinely fun way, creating a convivial atmosphere in the whole class. The "triangle into square" event while learning the necessary and sufficient condition impressed me the most in Mr Zhong's class. He made a silly mistake and wrote something incorrect!

Other things that fascinated me are also related to my new teacher, Doris. The moment Doris switched to the next slide of PPT, five enormous letters spelling DORIS leapt into view. They stand for five different meanings: These are determination, optimism, resilience, inspiration and success. It's also said that if we perform well in the first four areas, success will easily follow! However, I still have a question: why isn't the last one considered advanced vocabulary?

This is all the content of my first weekly diary in the brand new semester. I look forward to a better future!
